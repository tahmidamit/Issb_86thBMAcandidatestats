# Issb_86thBMAcandidatestats
This is my first big script ever. Sorry for the mistakes. I know a pro could've made it more efficiant but that's the best I can do for now.
This script will cross check written exam results with the issb websites call up list and tell you how many candidates have been called and how many are left.
Edit the code for new BMA sessions. Just edit the prefix to find and Change the board roll lists.
Have fun.
