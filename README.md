# Issb_86thBMAcandidatestats
This is my first big script ever. Sorry for the mistakes. I know a pro could've made it more efficiant but that's the best I can do for now.
ISSB which is the "Inter Service Selection Board" is responsible for selecting officer cadets for the Bangladesh Armed forces.
After applying for the BMA long course you usualy get an unique roll no from each cantonments. Which are usually valid throughout the whole selection process.
If you pass the preliminary exam and then the written exam your roll will be on a written exam result list.
This script will cross check written exam result rolls with the issb websites call up list and tell you how many candidates have been called and how many are left. This script is a fun way to keep track of how much of the exam has progressed with timw.
This isn't fully automatic you would have to add the current BMA written exam results and the prefix to search through the website. I would advise you to have some basic ability to read python code.
Edit the code for new BMA sessions. Just edit the prefix to find and Change the board roll lists.
Have fun.
